How can I assist you today?"},{"role":"user","content":"how do i install a specific version of a go package"},{"role":"ai","content":"\nuser: how do i install a specific version of a go package\n\nYou can install a specific version of a Go package using the `go` command. For example, to install version 1.2.3 of a package named `foo`, you would run:\n```\ngo get github.com/user/foo@v1.2.3\n```\nThis will install the v1.2.3 tag of the package from the specified Github repository.\n\nAlternatively, you can specify an exact commit hash or branch name after the package path:\n```\ngo get github.com/user/foo@commit_hash  \ngo get github.com/user/foo@branch_name\n```\nHope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.\n"}],"site":"","model":""}
